    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>We are learning how to make a website. The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term[1][2] for the half of Earth which lies west of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) and east of the antimeridian. The other half is called the Eastern Hemisphere. In geopolitical terms, the context in which the term is most often used, the Encyclopedia Britannica defines it as "North and South America and the surrounding waters. Longitudes 20°W and 160°E are often considered its boundaries." [3] It may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the "New World".</p>

    <h2>Toponomy</h2>
    <p>As an example of totum pro parte, the term Western Hemisphere is widely used by some, such as the United States government, to refer to the Americas.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] </p>
