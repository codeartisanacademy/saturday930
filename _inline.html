        <strong>Python</strong> was conceived in the late 1980s[34] by <em>Guido van Rossum</em> at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ( <abbr title="The real meaning">CWI</abbr> ) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL),[35] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba <i>operating system</i>.[7] Its <b>implementation</b> began in  December 1989.[36] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[37] He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.[38][39][40] In <span>January 2019</span>, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.[41] Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering council.[42]
